personal implementation in LeetCode with python3.

Note that some style might not be 'pythonic', 
the main reason is I want to speed up run time,
e.g. max() runs a lot slower than updating attr.
using if-statement; some may be 'too pythonic', 
using lots of map, reduce, filter, lambda, etc.
which may lost readability, since I want to ex-
pose myself to these functions, or for the 
potential speed-up.
